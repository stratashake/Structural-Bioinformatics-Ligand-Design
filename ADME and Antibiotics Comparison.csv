"In “Report on Antibiotic Drug Development for PopT Target.pdf”, I envisioned the novel antibiotic being an orally available compound. In “Report on Structure Analysis.pdf”, I used one lead compound (MCULE-7381215206-0-1) in my structure analysis. In both reports, I never concurrently considered the application of this compound, specifically, as an orally administered drug. Upon deeper analysis and reflection, particularly in understanding pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) interactions and ADME profiles, it has become apparent that MCULE-7381215206-0-1 may face some significant challenges as an orally administered drug.",,,,

"Despite its compliance with Lipinski's rule and synthetic accessibility, the compound's lower solubility, higher lipophilicity, and low predicted gastrointestinal (GI) absorption are significant hurdles for oral bioavailability. These factors are highly linked to the success of an orally administered drug and would require significant modifications or advanced formulation strategies in future development phases. These modifications and adaptations are beyond my current skills. Moreover, the potential for drug-drug interactions, particularly due to its inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, poses additional concerns for patient safety.",,,,

"This analysis has been an invaluable learning experience, underscoring the importance of a comprehensive evaluation of ADME profiles in early-stage drug development. It also highlights the need for comprehensive preclinical in silico screening and a more holistic, systems biology approach in drug development.",,,,
