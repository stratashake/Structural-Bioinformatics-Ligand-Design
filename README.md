# Exploration of DUF368 Protein/Polyprenyl-phosphate Transporter (PopT) as a Novel Antibiotic Target

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of research materials and analyses focusing on the DUF368-containing protein, a novel target for antibiotic development. 
The DUF368 protein plays a key role in bacterial cell wall maintenance and is a potential target for antibacterial drugs due to its absence in eukaryotes.
