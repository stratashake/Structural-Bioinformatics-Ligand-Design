# Exploration of DUF368 Protein/Polyprenyl-phosphate Transporter (PopT) as a Novel Antibiotic Target

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of research materials and analyses focusing on the DUF368-containing protein, a novel target for antibiotic development. 
The DUF368 protein plays a key role in bacterial cell wall maintenance and is a potential target for antibacterial drugs due to its absence in eukaryotes.

## Background
The rise of antibiotic resistance poses a significant challenge to public health. The DUF368 protein, found exclusively in bacterial species, is involved in the crucial process of cell wall synthesis and maintenance. By targeting this protein, the goal is develop antibiotics that are less likely to harm human cells, thereby offering a new avenue in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

## Methodology
The approach combines computational structural bioinformatics with ligand design and pharmacokinetics analysis.
